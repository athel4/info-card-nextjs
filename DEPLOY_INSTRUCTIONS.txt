DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
=======================

Your application has been successfully built for production deployment.
The build output is configured as a Static Export, which means it can be hosted on any standard web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) without needing a Node.js server.

1. LOCATE BUILD FILES
   ------------------
   Navigate to the `out` directory inside `newBase`:
   d:\vebmy\proj2\info-card-sorter\newBase\out

   This folder contains all the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and static assets required to run your application.

2. UPLOAD TO WEB SERVER
   --------------------
   Use your FTP client (e.g., FileZilla) to connect to your web server.
   Upload the CONTENTS of the `out` folder to your public web directory (usually `public_html`, `www`, or `htdocs`).

   Ensure you upload the files *inside* `out`, not the `out` folder itself (unless you want your site at domain.com/out).

3. SERVER CONFIGURATION (IMPORTANT)
   --------------------------------
   Since this is a Single Page Application (SPA) with client-side routing, you need to ensure your web server directs all requests to `index.html` (or the respective .html file) so that refreshing a page like `/dashboard` works.

   FOR APACHE (cPanel/Shared Hosting):
   Create or edit the `.htaccess` file in your `public_html` directory and add the following:

   <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteBase /
     RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
     RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
   </IfModule>

   FOR NGINX:
   Add `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;` to your location block.

4. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
   ---------------------
   The production environment variables (Supabase, Stripe, etc.) have been baked into the build. You do not need to upload the `.env` file to the server.

5. VERIFICATION
   ------------
   After uploading, visit your website URL (https://spark.vebmy.com).
   - Test signing in.
   - Test scanning a business card.
   - Check if navigation works (e.g., go to Dashboard and refresh the page).

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- If you see 404 errors on refresh, check step 3 (Server Configuration).
- If images are missing, ensure the `public` folder contents were uploaded correctly.
- If "No data extracted" errors persist, ensure the Supabase Edge Functions are deployed and accessible.

Deployment Package Ready!
